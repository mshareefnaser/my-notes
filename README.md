This repo talks about my notes on reading an article called [Learn the fundamentals of a good developer mindset in 15 minutes](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-fundamentals-of-a-good-developer-mindset-in-15-minutes-81321ab8a682/)
and here is what i learned:
- The purpose of software is **to help people**, not showing off your skills
- Your goal should be designing easy to use and maintainable systems, it have to be easy for you and helpful for others.
- understand your job rightly, misunderstanding leads to complexity
- Keep your work simple, so the others can understand it.
- Maintenance is important part, don't ignore it.
- Be consistent.  
- To make decesions on your software follow this formula: ***D=V/E*** 
    - The desirability of a change (D): How much do you want that change to happen?
    - The value of a change (V): How much value does the change offer? How much does it help your users?
    - The effort required to perform the change (E): How much work will you need to do to accomplish this change?
- Problem solving plays a big part in our job and here is how to do it:
    1. Understanding know exactly what being asked.
    1. Planning, don't take action, give your brain time to analyze.
    1. Divide, don't try to solve one big problems, solve it as sub-problems.
- Perfect is the enemy of good.
- It is hard to predict the future, so make your code generic as much as you need right now, generic solution includes a lot of code that isn't needed.
- Don't make assumptions, your solution should be based on what you know now.
- **Don't reinvent the wheel.** 
- Say **"NO"** for changes, until they are required and there is a real need for implementing them.
- If you can automate it, automate it.
- Don't measure your code by lines number, The optimum code is a small bunch of code that is easy to understand, easy to read. 

***Attention: you can easily fall in a trap that will cause you to write clever code that is hard to understand for others***

- To measure productivity, you have to think of how to make your codebase as small as possible, always ask yourself **"How can I remove more code?"**
- You should add logging in a very early stage. This will help you to find the problem easily and save your time.
- Break the big thing into smaller things. The smaller it is, the easier it is to estimate.

***Remember:
Everything takes longer than you think.***
- Write a comment to explain “WHY”, not to explain “WHAT”.
- It is important to have documentation:
    - to see the high-level picture of your software.
    - it will be easier to understand, especially for new developers.
- There are a few factors you should consider before you start using some technology:
    - Is there active development behind it?
    - Will it continue to be maintained?
    - How easy is it to switch away from?
    - What does the community say about it?
- Always invest in yourself, keep developing.
- Don’t be obsessive. Know when to quit. Don’t hesitate to ask for help.
- When you are not sure of how to do something, try to do anything and everything you know, When you can’t think of anything on your own, **search!** Find answers and try them out. **always look up for advice**, but you have to do it after doing everything you know.
